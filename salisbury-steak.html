    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound of lean ground beef</li>
            <li>1/3 cup dry bread crumbs</li>
            <li>1/4 cup chopped onions</li>
            <li>1 egg, beaten</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>2 cups beef broth</li>
        </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine ground beef, bread crumbs, chopped onion, egg, salt, and black pepper in a bowl until evenly mixed.
                 Shape beef mixture into 4 patties, about 3/4 inch thick.
                </li>
            <li>Fry patties in a large skillet over medium heat until browned on both sides, about 10 minutes.
                Add beef broth, onion, and mushroom; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, cover and simmer until
                patties are no longer pink in the center, about 10 minutes more. 
                Transfer patties to a platter and keep warm.
            </li>
            <li>Bring onion mixture to a boil. Mix cornstarch and water in a small bowl; stir into onion mixture.
                Cook and stir until onion gravy is thickened about 1 minute. Pour over patties to serve.
