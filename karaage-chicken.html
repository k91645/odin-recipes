    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>When we talk about the greatest fried chicken recipes of all time, karaage has to be at or near the top of that list. 
            This Japanese-style fried chicken is crispy, juicy, and intensely flavorful, which is even more impressive when you consider the fact that there is no skin or bones involved. 
            However, not all karaage recipes are created equal, and the awesomeness is very much dependent on how and what you coat your chicken pieces in.
